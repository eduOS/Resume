## AI Product Manager

9+ years building AI-powered products across NLP, knowledge graphs, OCR, and agentic AI systems, spanning founder-led zero-to-one and scale-up environments. End-to-end owner from user discovery and PRDs to delivery, MLOps, and iteration. I apply Norman, Krug, CRAP, Hooked (ethical), and NN/g heuristics to reduce cognitive load, prevent errors, and make system status and next steps obvious—without dark patterns.

## Core strengths
- Product strategy and execution: OKRs, RICE prioritization, roadmapping, PRDs, discovery/validation, stakeholder alignment
- AI/ML productization: LLMs/NLP, knowledge graphs, OCR pipelines, agentic orchestration (tool calling, planning, memory/state), model evaluation, human-in-the-loop, responsible AI
- UX and research: user interviews, JTBD, usability testing; Norman (affordances, feedback timing, natural mapping), Krug (one clear action), Williams/CRAP, NN/g heuristics (minimalism, visibility, error prevention, recognition over recall)
- Metrics and growth: funnel analysis (activation→retention), A/B tests, experiment design, north-star metrics, guardrail metrics
- Delivery and ops: agile, backlog management, release planning, post-launch analytics, instrumentation, agent loop monitoring, MLOps
- Collaboration: cross-functional leadership with design, data, engineering, content, and GTM

## Selected product outcomes
- Vocabulary Journal (Founder, 2022–2025): Shipped a PWA that helps language learners build a sustainable vocab habit.
  - Simplified each view to one primary action (Krug) and used recognition over recall for adding/organizing words (NN/g), improving task completion for first-time users.
  - Applied natural mapping and clear affordances for input vs. review modes; added visible sync/save states and undo to reduce anxiety (NN/g: visibility, error prevention).
  - Instrumented activation and 7-day retention funnels; iterated weekly based on logs and interviews; kept notifications informational, optional, and non-coercive (ethical Hooked loops).
  - Tech: Lit, TypeScript, Vite, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker; CI/CD to VPS with monitoring.
  - Prototyped agentic study aids with planner-executor loops, retrieval-augmented cues, and evaluation harnesses before gating release behind opt-in guardrails.

- Zhihuishu (AI Algorithm Tech Lead, 2021–2022): Integrated course knowledge graphs into content recommendation experiences.
  - Partnered with PMs, pedagogy experts, and engineering to define problem/solution fit and success metrics.
  - Designed OCR→concept mapping→exercise linking flow with clear progress indicators and retry/repair paths (NN/g visibility + error prevention).
  - Delivered a concept graph that enabled adaptive learning use cases; defined data quality SLAs and triage workflow.
  - Explored agent delegations for adaptive study plans, stress-tested agent policies with scenario-based evaluation, and codified escalation rules for human review.

- Alibaba Banma (Senior Algorithm Engineer, 2019–2021): Improved assistant addressee detection quality.
  - Reduced false positives from 5%→1.4% and increased recall 84%→93%, translating to fewer unintended activations and smoother user flows.
  - Established continual learning pipeline, data drift monitoring, and experiment reviews with guardrail metrics (latency, precision on critical intents).
  - Co-designed agent tool-use policies (retrieval vs. function calls) to minimize hallucinated handoffs and defined conflict-resolution heuristics for multi-skill arbitration.

## Experience
- Founder & Full‑Stack Product Builder • Vocabulary Journal • Remote • Nov 2022 – Oct 2025
  - Owned discovery→PRD→design→delivery; ran interviews and usability tests; prioritized via RICE and opportunity sizing.
  - Designed UI with CRAP principles (contrast for hierarchy, alignment/proximity for scanability, repetition for patterns) and ethical habit loops (no scarcity/anxiety triggers).
  - Implemented clear system status (sync states, progress, empty‑state guidance) and safe actions (undo, draft saves).
  - Shipped weekly increments; used event logs/heatmaps to drive roadmap adjustments.
  - Built agentic experiment track with tool-calling orchestrator, scratchpad memory, dynamic prompting, and risk controls (rate limits, fallbacks, manual review queue).

- AI Algorithm Tech Lead • Zhihuishu • Shanghai • Oct 2021 – Nov 2022
  - Led roadmap for AI‑powered learning artifacts (KGs, OCR links) with measurable quality metrics and SLAs.
  - Coordinated cross‑functional reviews; wrote PRDs, defined acceptance criteria, and release plans.
  - Introduced agent evaluation loops (task-level replay, guardrail tests) and readiness checklists for semi-autonomous content drafting flows.

- Senior Algorithm Engineer • Alibaba Group – Banma • Shanghai • May 2019 – Oct 2021
  - Co‑led initiatives tying model quality to user experience outcomes; set up experimentation and guardrails.
  - Collaborated with design to minimize cognitive load in voice assistant error recovery flows.
  - Piloted an agent handoff framework (planner, tool router, debate) to reduce dead-end flows in voice assistance.

- AI Algorithm Engineer • ifchange.com • Shanghai • Oct 2018 – Jan 2019
  - Worked on person‑job fit and ranking; partnered with PM to align offline metrics with recruiter task success.

- NLP Researcher • deepbrain.ai • Shanghai • Nov 2015 – Sep 2018
  - Built summarization and NER components; documented model limitations and UX safeguards for downstream apps.

## Principles I apply
- Norman: make controls obvious (affordances), map actions naturally to outcomes, and give immediate, meaningful feedback.
- Krug: remove needless choices and keep one clear primary action per section/screen.
- Williams/CRAP: use contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity to guide attention and improve scanability.
- Hooked (ethical): support healthy habit loops via value‑first triggers and easy completion; never use anxiety, dark patterns, or coercive defaults.
- NN/g: aesthetic‑minimal design, strong visibility of system status, error prevention and graceful recovery, and recognition over recall.
- Agentic AI: design planner-executor loops with monitored tool calls, scratchpad memory, autonomous retries, and human-overridden guardrails.
